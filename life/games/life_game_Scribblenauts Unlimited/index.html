Place a rainbow bait in the water and he’ll proceed to nab that as well. Finally, a fudge megalodon will appear. Toss in a chocolate and the Starite appears.</p>

Get through the room with the spiky platforms by tripping the first wire and stepping back; then trip the second one and run to the space between the traffic cones. Once it’s safe, head downstairs to the room. Wait for the robot to finish firing, then run quickly through the room before all the lights turn on. The game wants you to grab the Starite, so trip the wire and watch as it’s destroyed. However, you can still make things right. Grab the key and head upstairs. Use a magnet to pull the spiky steel ball to where the Starite was, then go back down and to the left. Pull the lever. The gate rises, but is electrified. Modify Maxwell to be tiny and run underneath. Use a jetpack to fly up and press the red button. Wait for the TNT to explode, then proceed to cross the roof in time to the lightning.

The next alien is afraid of loud noises, so grab a drumset and play it near the baby. The following alien is terrified of water, so place a storm over the cat. Finally, the last alien is afraid of heights. However, there’s an imposter in our midst! The secret agent is actually an alien! Modify her to be floating and she’ll revert to alien form, revealing the Starite along the way.</p>
<p>The Listy Colon is the twentieth level in Scribblenauts Unlimited. The entire level consists of a pirate ship, of which Maxwell’s brother Yarrr seems to be the captain.</p>

Place a mirror near him to break the next curse. The smartest member has been turned into a mindless ghoul. Give him a brain to proceed to the final challenge, where the ghost captain must be reunited with his parrot.

<h2 id="starite-2-7"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#starite-2-7"></a> STARITE 2</h2>
<p>Good sailors are hard to find. Help make it easier for the captain and create some. To complete the “Where Can I Find Some Sailors?” Starite, begin by helping the slacker kid who inherited the ship find someone to steer. Place a sailor at the wheel. Next we’ll need someone to keep track of the booty, so put a treasurer in the treasure room. Weapons are an important part of a ship, so place a warrior in the bottom left of the ship. Keep the crew well-fed by putting a chef in the kitchen. Next we’ll need a captive to keep in the brig, so place a native inside. Finally, place a navigator in the crow’s nest and the Starite will appear.</p>
<p>After the cutscene that introduces the plot of the game ends, you will find yourself on a farm. Your first objective is to walk over toward Edwin, Maxwell’s brother, near the right side of the level. On-screen images will instruct you on how to walk. Speak to Edwin, and you’ll be prompted to assist him with his award-winning pig. You must do this by finishing a number of tasks.</p>
<p>“Turn the runt of the litter into an award winning pig! Write an object to help Maxwell scrub the pig!”<br>
“Type something to clean the pig!”<br>
This can be anything from a “brush” to a “toothbrush” (don’t limit your creativity). Alternate Items: Soap, Shampoo</p>
<p>Remove the object you used to clean the pig by dropping it in the trash can.</p>
<p>“The pig looks great! Now use an adjective to increase the pig’s size!”<br>
Do this by adding an adjective to the pig that will increase its size. Type anything from “big” to “ginormous”.</p>
<p>“Help the pig win the talent competition! Use an adjective and a noun to create wings large enough to carry the pig!”<br>
“Hints are unlocked over time! Click on the associated object to view its hint!”<br>
Click the pig to view the new hint!</p>
<p>“I need wings large enough to help me fly.”<br>
Add wings large enough to help the pig fly by creating an object such as “big wings”. Any adjective that implies that the wings will be big is good enough.</p>
<p>“The magic backpack stores objects for later! Throw the wings in the backpack and wait for the judges to arrive!”<br>
Place the wings you’ve created into your magic backpack. The judges will arrive just seconds after you’ve done this. Now you must take the wings from the magic backpack and attach them to the pig. A short cutscene will begin in which the judges talk for a while, and then the pigs are placed in order based on size. Your pig will win the contest, and a Starite will appear in front of your pig. Walk over to the Starite and pick it up.</p>
<p>“Earn Shards by helping people! Ten shards will form a Starite! Use Starite Vision to find shards!”<br>
Activate Starite Vision by clicking the Starite icon, which is next to the backpack icon in the top left corner of the screen. Then click on Edwin, who is highlighted in gold. A hint will appear:</p>
<p>“Help the sprout grow!”<br>
Turn off Starite Vision, open your notepad, and create an object that will help Edwin’s sprout grow. This can be anything from “water” to “rain”.</p>
<p>Alternate Items: Water Bottle, River</p>
<p>The sprout will turn into a vicious monster plant and scare away Edwin and the Sad Girl.</p>
<p>“The plant scared away the other shard opportunity! Reset the level to return all objects to their original state, while keeping your earned shards!”<br>
Go to the main menu and restart the level. Don’t worry-- this will save your current progress.</p>
<p>“While the notepad can create many things, vulgarity, copyrighted materials, and proper nouns are not allowed.”<br>
Using Starite Vision on the Sad Girl will bring up the hint:</p>
<p>“My kitty is stuck on top of the tree! Get her for me!”<br>
Do this by creating anything from a “ladder” to a flight of “big stairs”. Anything that will allow you to reach the top of the tree works.</p>
<p>Alternate Method: Just climb up the tree without conjuring up anything. Then retrieve the cat and climb back down.</p>
<p>Grab the cat, and bring it safely back to the Sad Girl.</p>
<p>“Learning the basics was just the first step towards saving Lily! Use the bus stop to begin your journey in Capital City!”<br>
Completing this level will allow you to play as Maxwell’s brother Edwin. Simply click Maxwell and select “Pick Avatar” to play as any unlocked brother.</p>
<p>In order to reach the next level, walk all the way to the right side of Edwin’s farm until you reach the bus stop. Use the bus stop to travel to Capital City.</p>
<p>Capital City is the second level in Scribblenauts Unlimited.</p>
<p>A cockroach can be found on this level near Shard 2. It’s not recommended that you create another cockroach. Creating another cockroach will allow the two to multiply extremely quickly. If this happens, no Shards will be able to be earned unless the level is reset.</p>
<p>After finding all of the Shards and the Starite in Capital City, the game will bring you back to Edwin’s Farm to speak to Lily, who will introduce more levels for you to play on, along with a map to provide quicker travel between areas.</p>
<h1 id="m17"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#m17"></a> M17</h1>
<h2 id="shard-1-17"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#shard-1-17"></a> SHARD 1</h2>
<p>Upon arriving in Capital City, you’ll find a Bored Boy just to the left of the bus stop. The hint you’ll find says:</p>
<p>“I want someone to entertain me!”</p>
<p>This one is simple. Create anything the boy would find mildly entertaining such as an “elephant” or “balloon”. Playing a guitar in front of him, however, does not work. Upon success, you will earn the first Shard found in Capital City.</p>
<p>Alternate Items: Joker, Clown</p>
<h2 id="shard-2-17"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#shard-2-17"></a> SHARD 2</h2>
<p>Further to the left of the now Happy Boy is an illegally-parked car. The goal here is to move the car away from the area that’s illegal to park in. Simply create a “towtruck”, attach the chain to the illegally-parked car, and remove the car from the area. A security guard will appear out of nowhere, get upset that the car has been removed, and you’ll be awarded with the second Shard found in Capital City.</p>
<p>Alternate Method: Make a rope and attach it to the car and then to you. Then, simply walk away from the car to pull it with you.</p>
<p>The security guard will appear as an enemy, and throw a binder at you whenever you get near him. This will deal damage to you, so be careful. Adding the adjective “happy” to the security guard will render him harmless.</p>
<h2 id="shard-3-17"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#shard-3-17"></a> SHARD 3</h2>
<p>Further to the left of Shard 2 is graffiti located on the wall of a building. Scrub the graffiti off with something like a “washcloth” or “soap” and you will be awarded with the third Shard found in Capital City.</p>
<p>Note: Water items, such as rain and water bottle, will not work.</p>
<p>Erasing the graffiti will cause a park bench, light pole, and two trees to appear out of nowhere.</p>
<h2 id="shard-4-17"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#shard-4-17"></a> SHARD 4</h2>
<p>Near the graffiti is Maxwell’s brother Clark flying in circles. To the left of him is a telephone booth. Create and place any human being into the telephone booth such as a “boy” or “sidekick” in order to turn them into his sidekick. Doing so will earn you the fourth Shard found in Capital City.</p>
<p>Note: Any type of human will work, including veteranarian, trashman, and engeneer.</p>
<p>After creating an accomplice for Clark, a cat burglar will appear and Clark and his accomplice will chase after him. Doing this will unlock Clark as an Avatar.</p>
<h2 id="shard-5-16"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#shard-5-16"></a> SHARD 5</h2>
<p>Near the telephone booth is a switch and a pool of water. Place any object into the fountain, pull the switch, and a fountain for the city will be created. Literally anything can be placed into the pool of water and turned into a fountain. This will earn your the fifth Shard found in Capital City. It will look cooler if the item is made out of stone, so try a stone elephant.</p>
<p>After creating the fountain, a schoolboy and schoolgirl will appear and throw money into the fountain.</p>
<h2 id="shard-6-17"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#shard-6-17"></a> SHARD 6</h2>
<p>Beyond Shard 5’s fountain and the Starite’s carnival, you’ll find a dock. At the end of the dock is an old man who wants to sail across the sea. Create any source of water transportation such as a “sailboat” and place it in the water. The man will hop into it and sail off, and you’ll be awarded with the sixth Shard found in Capital City.</p>

<h2 id="shard-7-16"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#shard-7-16"></a> SHARD 7</h2>
<p>Backtrack a bit until you reach the telephone booth at Shard 5. To the right of the telephone booth is an entrance into a building. Enter it, and you’ll find yourself at the roof of that building with two unhappy tourists who can’t see the view because the clouds are in the way. Create something that can blow the clouds out of the way such as a “fan” and you’ll be awarded with the seventh Shard found in Capital City.</p>
<p>After the clouds are blown out of the way, a rainbow and sun will appear, and the tourists will become happy.</p>
<p>Alternate Items: Wind’, Breeze</p>
<h2 id="shard-8-12"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#shard-8-12"></a> SHARD 8</h2>
<p>A gorilla can be found on top of the hospital near the beginning of this level. Pan the camera up toward it, and you’ll find that the gorilla wants to be “kinged”. Place a “princess” next to him or give him a “crown”, and you’ll be awarded with the eighth and final Shard found in Capital City.</p>
<p>After this, an airplane will appear and begin shooting the ape. The ape will then die, and the princess will escape.</p>
<p>Alternate Items: Tiara, Queen</p>
<h2 id="starite-10"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#starite-10"></a> Starite</h2>
<p>Speak to the man found beyond the fountain at Shard 5. This will begin the carnival games. The first game requires you to throw something to knock over the bottles without crossing the barrier. Simply create something that can be thrown such as a “ball”. Click the bottom, second-to-right bottle in order to be given the “throw” command. Throw the ball at the bottles and knock them over. A giant ball isn’t necessary, as the bottles will all break once one is broken.</p>
<p>Note: Any throwable item will work. A ball isn’t necessary.</p>
<p>The next game requires you to throw something to pop the balloons being carried by the clown without crossing the barrier. Create something sharp that can be thrown such as a “dart”.</p>
<p>Note: Once again, there isn’t any limit. Anything that can be thrown at a balloon will work.</p>
<p>The next game requires you to throw something to hit the dunk tank without crossing the barrier. If the ball you created earlier is still around, just throw that at the dunk tank.</p>
<p>Note: Anything throwable will work</p>
<p>You will be awarded a Starite for completing this task.</p>
<h2 id="sub-level"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#sub-level"></a> Sub Level</h2>
<p>There is a sub-level that can be accessed on the world map. This level is called Capital City Runoff.</p>
<p>Capital City Runoff is a relatively small level, as it’s actually a sub-level. It’s also a pretty unimportant level, as there are no Starites and only 6 Shards to collect. Nevertheless, they are required for a 100% playthrough. The level can be accessed through the world map.</p>

<p>The fifth Shard is located on the fourth floor of the hospital. On the fourth floor are two patients who would be motivated to win a race if they saw something painted with their team colors. One patient’s team color is blue, the other patient’s team color is red. Paint something red or blue, or create anything with one of those colors such as a “blue flag”, and you will earn the fifth Shard found in St. Asterisk.</p>
<p>Alternate Method: You can also change the adjectives of current things lying around. There is no need to make a completely new item.</p>
