<p>Third, the fireman needs a tool that will help put fires out. Create and attach a “fire hose” to the fireman.</p>
<p>Fourth, traffic is terrible and the car needs to get over the traffic. Create and attach a “jetpack” to the car and you will be awarded the first of two Starites available at the Capital City Firehouse.</p>

The Under Line is the sixth level in Scribblenauts Unlimited. This level takes place in an underground sewer line.</p>
<h1 id="m2"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#m2"></a> M2</h1>
<h2 id="shard-1-2"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#shard-1-2"></a> SHARD 1</h2>
<p>The first shard is obtained by helping a Maxwell’s chubby brother Gorge with an empty vending machine. Create something sweet, such as candy, and put it inside the machine, which will then spill it out, causing Gorge to give you the “Snack Time” shard and also unlocking Gorge as an Avatar. Or create any kind of food and give it to george.</p>
<h2 id="shard-2-2"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#shard-2-2"></a> SHARD 2</h2>

<h2 id="starite"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#starite"></a> Starite</h2>
<p>For the Starite, you must help a street performer get his rockstar career rolling. First he’ll need an instrument; give him a drumset or a trumpet or some such. Any good band needs more than one member, so write in a singer or guitarist. Next, give them some real equipment, like speakers or an amp. A stage will appear, people will gather, and you’ll nab the “Street Rock” Starite.</p>
<p>Hyphen Heights is the seventh level in Scribblenauts Unlimited. It is a multilevel suburban community.</p>

<p>A pair of baseball-playing kids lost their ball in the old man’s yard, but retrieving it involves not touching the lawn. Don a jetpack and fly over to grab it without touching the lawn.
